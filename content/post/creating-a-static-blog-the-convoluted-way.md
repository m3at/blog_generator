_TLDR: I wanted to create a static blog while being able to type articles from a nice UI, from anywhere. It is quite straightforward with_ [_forestry_](https://forestry.io/) _+_ [_hugo_](https://gohugo.io/) _+_ [_github pages_](https://pages.github.com/)_._ [jump](#tldr-jump)

If you're looking to create a blog, you're in luck! There are countless tools to help you get up and running in a few minutes. For example [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) will generate a static site from a few markdown files, and pushing it to github in a repository named `YOUR_USERNAME.github.io` will put you online.

That's it! You're done! :sparkles:

However if it's too easy it isn't fun. Also by accepting what's good enough, you might actually write _content_ into your blog! Let's not do that.

{#tldr-jump}Here are my requirements:

1. The website should be **static**. It makes hosting cheap or even free.
2. **Modifying any parts** should be possible. I want control of my site.
3. Once set-up, I should be able to **focus on the content**. No distraction from the command line, just press save and be done.
4. Be able to **edit from anywhere**. That typo your friend noticed? Fix it with a quick edit from your phone!

The first two can be satisfied by any static site generator. The third can be solved by a nice tool like [Publii](https://getpublii.com/), though it does make customizing details a bit more tricky. Editing from anywhere is easy with commercial offerings like [WordPress](https://wordpress.com/), but the website is not static and I would need to give up a lot of control.

The solution for all four come from static **content management system** (CMS), which â€“as the name implyâ€“ will provide tools to manage your content and generate your static site.

I found two candidates: [NetlifyCMS](https://www.netlifycms.org/) and [Forestry.io](https://forestry.io/). Both are promising and let you work with a site generator of you choosing. However I needed to chose one, and forestry's editor looked prettier ðŸ¤©

Here are the necessary steps:

* Create a github repository matching your username, for example _`jondoe`_`.github.io` (if you're not familiar with git or github, head [over there](https://pages.github.com/) for some simple explanations). Once done `git clone https://github.com/`_`jondoe`_`/`_`jondoe`_`.github.io`
* Install Hugo and follow the [quick start guide](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/). Now is a good time to [choose a theme](https://themes.gohugo.io/).
* Once you're done setting up your site, copy the generated static site (under `./public`) to your _`jondoe`_`.github.io` directory. Push
