# About me

Hi there, I'm Paul Willot. I grew up in France and moved to Japan for my first job. I started as a programmer, mainly for tasks centered on machine learning, and recently moved into project and team leadership.

I enjoy talking about machine learning, programming, sysadmin and life in Japan.  
Though I can't promise an immediate reply, feel free to [email me](mailto:kiwi.pwillot@gmail.com). I'm happy to talk to you!
